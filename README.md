This web application helps you manage and filter your favorite Spotify playlists. It allows you to "track" a source playlist, creating your own personal, filterable copy. When you remove a song you don't like from your version, the app remembers your choice and won't re-add it, even when the original playlist updates.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Playlist Tracking:** Create a personal, tracked copy of any public Spotify playlist.
* **Smart Sync:** Update your tracked playlist with new songs from the source playlist with a single click.
* **Dislike Memory:** Songs you remove from your tracked playlist are permanently remembered and ignored in future syncs.
* **Automated Weekly Syncs:** Set your playlists to update automatically every week.
* **Web-Based UI:** Manage your playlists through a simple, clean, and modern web interface.
