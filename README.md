# Trackify Spotify Playlist Tracker

Trackify is a web application that helps you manage and filter your favorite Spotify playlists. It allows you to "track" a source playlist (like the UK Top 100) and maintain your own version. If you remove a song you don't like from your version, Trackify remembers your choice and won't re-add it, even when the original playlist updates.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Playlist Tracking:** Create a personal, tracked copy of any public Spotify playlist.
* **Smart Sync:** Update your tracked playlist with new songs from the source playlist.
* **Dislike Memory:** Songs you remove from your tracked playlist are permanently ignored in future syncs.
* **Web-Based UI:** Manage your playlists through a simple web interface.
* **(Planned) Automated Weekly Syncs:** Set your playlists to update automatically every week.
